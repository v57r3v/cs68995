THE TASK
For this assessment, you must develop an   interactive   media   prototype which could   be   used as a training   resource by volunteers at York Archaeology’s   Barley   Hall attraction.
You must also write a 2,250 word individual   Design   Report   explaining   and   reflecting   on the design and development   process you adopted.
This assessment   is worth   100% of the total marks for this module.   
GUIDANCE
The design   brief:
Volunteers at   Barley   Hall get   involved as   Room Guides,   helping to   welcome   and guide visitors to the attraction, supporting visitor engagement by offering   information   and answering questions about the   history and archaeology of   Barley   Hall.
Volunteers deliver this information to both visiting families and   adults   and   learn the   content and skills they need for this from written   information packs   and   training   slides   that can be text   heavy   and   a   little   dry.
The York Archaeology Volunteer Management Team would like   to explore   opportunities to create more accessible, enjoyable training   resources for volunteers including a media   based   resource which would allow self-led,   bite-sized   learning that   helps volunteers to   bring the history of Barley   Hall to   life for our visitors.      Any resource should account for the diversity of age and backgrounds   in   the   volunteer   audience by offering simple, easy to navigate   resources   suitable for a   wide   range   of   technical capabilities and learning   styles.
You will   have access to existing volunteer training   resources (along with   potentially   other historical and archaeological resources as directed   by the   Volunteer Management Team) to create an output which focuses on one of the   key   spaces recommended for volunteering and addresses one of the following areas of   interpretation (already explored in the   attraction);


•          In the Great   Hall; the tablewares and table   setting   and   how these would   have   been   used and experienced during a medieval feast at   Barley   Hall,   including where   people would have sat,   how guests would have   been served,   and   the order of seating
•          In the   Lesser Chamber; the bed, crib   and   other furnishings   in this   room   that   tell the story of daily   life and   routine   in   medieval   Barley   Hall,   including such activities as sleeping, washing, socialising and prayer
Please also   note the expectations of the client and student work as   documented   in the   “Community   Projects Student Code of Conduct” available   on the VLE.
The format:
Your project could take a   number of forms, and the   museum   is   interested   in creative   solutions to the problem.   However,   it should adhere to a couple   of guidelines:
•          It should be historically   accurate   (at   least   in   feel)   -   it   can   include   imagined characters and settings,   but these should be appropriate to the   time   period.
•          It should draw from existing   learning material   (which will   be   provided to   you)   for the content   it needs   to   deliver
•          It   must consider the volunteer audience (aged   18-80+)   in both   tone   and   features and allow for different   learning   styles
•          Be suitable for use on a smart   phone   and   computer to   allow for   different   technological capabilities and   preferred usage
•         Support self-led,   bite-sized   learning to allow   individual topics to   be   learnt   in   small chunks.
•         Support continual learning by structuring   material to   allow volunteers to   log/map the information gained and onward goals   in an   enjoyable   way.
•         Support volunteers to understand accurate   information via clear signposting   or feedback of correct   information or answers.
•         Allow volunteers to find and   revisit   information they may   need again.
•         Offer high   levels of accessibility
•          It should aim to   be   both   informative and   engaging
•          It should be designed for administration   by a   small team   of 2   staff   (e.g   24   hour   access to support or   chat functions would   not be   available)
•         You must   not include any York Archaeology branding   on your
interactive media   prototype   but   it should fit with York Archaeology branding   styles   in fe代 写User Experience Design, TFT00036IJava

•         You must   not gather any primary data from York Archaeology volunteers   or   visitors for this assessment.
•         You may include assets (e.g. text,   images,   media) from   existing   sources   in
your prototype as   long as they are   properly acknowledged   in   a   Copyright   Appendix to your report.
•         You should carefully consider the use of AI technologies to ensure the   ethical   and accurate   presentation of information or visuals.
•          Data   provided   by York Archaeology should   not be   provided to or used   in   any AI systems or tools.
Prototype   Medium:
The choice of medium for your   Interactive   Media   Prototype   is up   to you. You   could   consider the following options:
●         A   prototype   of   your   design   with   Wizard   of   Oz   functionality   - evidence   of   this could be submitted   by a video demonstrating the design   concept   in   action.
●         A game (e.g. telling a story   in a   playful way   that   may   aid   learning   or   provide information), submitted as a packaged   Unity executable or   Processing   sketch   (in   particular see the submission guidelines).
●         A video illustrating your design   (e.g. showing your design   in use,   or   a   narrated   screen   capture   of   an   Adobe   XD, or   similar, prototype).
●         A visualisation or interactive   narrative submitted as a   Processing sketch.
●         A   responsive website designed for desktop or mobile use, submitted   as   a   self-   contained file directory.
Regardless of which medium you choose, your Interactive   Media   Prototype   must   be submitted   in ONE of the following file formats:
●          Video   (.mov;   .mpeg4 or   .mp4)
●          Unity   (zip file containing executable   builds   for both   Windows   and   Mac   platforms and source files)
●          Processing   (as a zip file containing executable   builds for   both Windows   and   Mac   platforms and source files)
●          Website   (folder with   local assets, e.g.   .jpg,   .png, and   HTML, CSS and   JavaScript. files)
On the   Design   Report:
This report   should   include:
●          Title: A   report title that describes your design.
●          Overview: A   150-word summary suitable for an external audience   (e.g., suitable for publishing on a portfolio website) that succinctly   describes   the      context (i.e., the   Barley   Hall attraction), your design process   (i.e. what you   did), your inspiration, and your design   concept.
●          Design Approach: A description of the approach and methods   you   used   to
generate your design concept (i.e., desk-based   research,   information from   the   museum staff etc.,), your approach to ethical data gathering   (e.g. for usability         testing), and   how this   informed your design (e.g. personas,   user   journey   maps   etc.).
●          Design Statement: A statement describing the challenge or   opportunity   your   design seeks to address. This should refer to your   understanding of the wider   UK and global museum context, as well   as the   specifics   of the   Barley   Hall   attraction, and any desk-based user research you   did.   Make sure   you   state   which theme you   have chosen to focus on and why you decided   on   this.
●          Design Context: At   least three   researched and   referenced examples
relevant to your design that inspired you (e.g., an   international   art   installation,   an   immersive   museum experience, an online game).
●          Development Process: A written and visual description of   how you   created   and   iterated your prototype, for instance, from early sketches to first   stage paper-based prototype through to final prototype as submitted.   This   should   include details of any usability testing and evaluation that you   conducted.
●          Critical   Reflection: A personal critical reflection on   your   completed   prototype   and the process you took to make   it. What would you   change   or   rework   if you   could   revise and   reiterate the design again?
You must meet the target   number of words as stated   on this   brief. You   are   allowed a   10% leeway either way (i.e. 225 words   over   or   under   is   acceptable).   The   word count must be   stated clearly   at   the   end   of the   report.
Appendices,   if appropriate, do not count towards the 2,250 word   report word   limit.
You should   note that over- or under-writing   beyond the   limits of the   leeway   may   incur   mark deductions with   respect to the clarity of your work per the assessment and feedback criteria.
